# Romanify 🏛️

The official documentation and landing page for **@charmingdc/romanify**, a high-precision TypeScript utility designed to convert integers into Roman numerals with support for large-scale values via vinculum (overline) notation.

This project is built to showcase the library's capabilities, providing a clean and responsive interface for developers to understand its implementation and integration.

## Project Overview

Romanify solves the limitation of traditional Roman numeral converters by implementing overline notation for values exceeding 3,999. The documentation site itself is built with a modern tech stack to ensure high performance, type safety, and an exceptional developer experience.

## Features

- **Large Value Support**: Converts positive integers beyond 3,999 using standard overline notation.
- **Strictly Type-Safe**: Entirely written in TypeScript for robust integration.
- **Minimalist Design**: A documentation site focused on readability and simplicity.
- **Optimized Performance**: Built with Vite and Tailwind CSS for near-instant load times.
- **Developer Centric**: Includes clear usage examples and design decision logs.

// Basic conversion
const year = romanize(2024); // MMXXIV

// Large value conversion
const largeValue = romanize(5000); // V with overline
```
